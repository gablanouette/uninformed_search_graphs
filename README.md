# Artificial Intelligence: Uninformed Search Graphs


This project is an introduction to uninformed search graphs in Artificial Intelligence and will visualize graphs.

This purpose of this project is to:
  - use Python to represent trees and graphs
  - manipulate trees and graphs
  - visualize trees and graphs
  - use Python for uninformed graph search

A graph is a collection of vertices, or nodes, and edges, which are connections between different vertices (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics). These graphs are visually represented with labels enclosed in a circle for the vertices, and lines connecting vertices which are the edges.

A directed graph has edges that are arrows, meaning there is a connection from one vertex to another, any other graph is an undirected graph.
