# This project is a wonderful introduction project when learning Artificial Intelligence
# This project will visualize graphs 

# This purpose of this project is to:
#   - use Python to represent trees and graphs
#   - manipulate trees and graphs
#   - visualize trees and graphs
#   - use Python for uninformed graph search

# a graph is a collection of vertices, or nodes, and edges, which are connections between different 
# vertices (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics). These graphs are visually
# represented with labels enclosed in a circle for the vertices, and lines connecting vertices
# which are the edges.

# a directed graph has edges that are arrows, meaning there is a connection from one vertex to 
# another, any other graph is an undirected graph.

# Python library to use when working with graphs: networkx

# import packages
import pandas as pd
import networkx as nx
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
